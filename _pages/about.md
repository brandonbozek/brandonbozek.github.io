I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Astronomy Department of the
University of Texas at Austin. While I am currently working as an
astrophysicist, I am very interested in pursuing a career in data science.
The root of my passion for astronomy lies in investigating large datasets to
develop novel solutions and distill data-driven insights. I enjoy learning
new analytic techniques and visualization methods that allow me to apply my
experience as an astronomical researcher to non-astronomical problems, which
I blog about here. In my free time, I enjoy swimming, softball, hiking and
being a father to an adorable two year-old.

My astrophysics research focuses on understanding the nature of dark matter,
particularly as it relates to the formation and evolution of galaxies. To do
this, I use high performance supercomputers to simulate the local volume of
the Universe throughout cosmic time. My Ph.D. thesis "Explorations in Dark
Energy" covered a range of topics related to dark energy, the mysterious
force driving the accelerated expansion of the Universe. A list of my
research papers can be found on
